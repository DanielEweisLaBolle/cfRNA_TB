Circulating Cell-Free RNA in Blood as a Host Response Biomarker for the Detection of Tuberculosis
This repository contains the pipeline and analysis scripts used to evaluate TB markers in plasma cfRNA.

The cfRNA pipeline has an individual Readme with instructions on how to run the pipeline. Full sequencing files will be made available on dbGAP.

All scripts and files to recreate the paper figures, including metadata and count matrices, can be found within the "Files_For_Manuscript" and "Scripts_For_Manuscript" folders.
